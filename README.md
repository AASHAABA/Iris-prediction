### Having been one of the most classic beginner datasets and a great way to explore supervised machine learning and classification. This project was inspired by Jason Brownleeâ€™s book Machine Learning Mastery with Python. Some code snippets and ideas were adapted from his work to aid learning and implementation.
### The Iris dataset used was introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936 and is available via the UCI Repository and scikit-learn. Special thanks to the open-source community for tools like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
